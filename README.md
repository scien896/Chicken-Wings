A grill,or a oven,or a pan,or a deep fryer; essenntially some sort of cooking device
Thermometer
Metal tray
Cooling rack
Two large bowls
At most 5 dishes or smaller bowls

Preparations:
1. Start by defrosting the wings, preferably a few hours before the time of cooking
2. Put the Eggs, Flour, and the breadcrumbs into SEPARATE small bowls.
3. Start the warming process on youe device, such as if it is a oven, then set it to preheat to 350 degrees farenheit, or if it is a deepfyer, set it to 400 degrees farenheit, you should get the gist of what i am saying at this point.
Cooking Procedure:
Start by putting the wings in the eggs, then the flour, then the eggs again, then the Breadcrumbs. To be concise, the dipping order is Eggs, Flour, Eggs, and finally Breadcrumbs.
After you have done this, the process varies by cooking method. If you have a deep fryer, put them in as soon as you finish breading the wings, and fry them until they reach a nice brown color. If you have a oven, put them all on the metal tray and bake them for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.
After this step, if you went the fryer route, line the metal pan with paper towels, and let thge wings rest for 10 minutes. If you went the oven route, let them rest for 5 minutes.
After they are done resting, then you pour about a cup of your sauce of choice, into one of the bowls, and cover it with plastic wrap. Toss it about lightly, in a manner in which the wings are evenly coated, but the plastic wrap doesn't come off, allowing the sauce to go everywhere.
Finally take them out of the bowl, and place them in the second large bowl, and serve.
